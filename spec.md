Specification: Python FastAPI Orchestrating Service
Overview
The Python FastAPI Orchestrating Service is a scalable and extensible API gateway that dynamically routes requests to attached API endpoints based on a configuration file. It provides features such as dynamic endpoint registration, health checks, circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance, and an endpoint statistics API for monitoring.
Architecture

The service is built using Python and the FastAPI web framework.
It follows a modular architecture, separating concerns into distinct components:

Configuration Manager: Handles parsing and reloading of the YAML configuration file.
Endpoint Registry: Manages dynamic registration and unregistration of API endpoints.
Request Router: Routes incoming requests to the appropriate attached endpoint based on the configuration.
Circuit Breaker: Implements the circuit breaker pattern for health checks and fault tolerance.
Authentication Middleware: Handles JWT authentication for the orchestrating API.
Endpoint Statistics API: Provides an API to retrieve statistics and details about the attached endpoints.



Configuration

API endpoint configuration is stored in a YAML file.
Each endpoint entry includes the following fields:

url (required): The URL of the attached endpoint.
name (optional): A unique identifier or name for the endpoint.
version (optional): The API version of the endpoint.
methods (optional): The supported HTTP methods for the endpoint (e.g., GET, POST).
auth_type (optional): The authentication type required by the endpoint.
disabled (optional): A flag to indicate if the endpoint is disabled (default: false).


The Configuration Manager component handles parsing and validating the YAML configuration file.
An API endpoint or command is provided to trigger a configuration reload when the YAML file is updated.

Dynamic Endpoint Registration and Unregistration

Endpoints can be dynamically registered or unregistered by updating the YAML configuration file.
The Endpoint Registry component manages the registration and unregistration process.
During the reload process, the service skips any endpoints with the disabled flag set to true.

Health Checks and Monitoring

The service performs health checks on the attached endpoints using the circuit breaker pattern.
The Circuit Breaker component manages the state of each endpoint (open, closed, half-open).
Circuit breaker parameters are configurable:

failure_threshold: The number of consecutive failures required to trip the circuit breaker.
reset_timeout: The time period after which the circuit breaker transitions from open to half-open state.
fallback_strategy: The action to take when the circuit breaker is open (e.g., return cached response, default value, or error message).



Authentication and Authorization

The orchestrating API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication.
The Authentication Middleware component handles the validation and extraction of JWTs from request headers.
Each attached endpoint is responsible for its own authentication and authorization.
The orchestrating service forwards requests to attached endpoints as-is, including any authentication headers.

Endpoint Statistics API

The service provides an API endpoint (/endpoints/stats) to retrieve statistics and details about the attached endpoints.
The Endpoint Statistics API component handles the generation and retrieval of endpoint statistics.
The response includes a list of registered endpoints with relevant information:

Endpoint URL
Unique identifier or name
API version
Supported HTTP methods
Authentication type
Current status (enabled/disabled)
Health check status (up/down)
Circuit breaker state (open/closed/half-open)
Last update timestamp


Access to the endpoint statistics API is restricted to authorized users or systems.

Error Handling and Logging

The service implements consistent error handling and logging practices across all components.
Errors are caught and handled gracefully, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error responses.
Detailed error messages and stack traces are logged for debugging purposes.
Logging is configurable and can be adjusted based on the environment (e.g., debug, info, warning, error).

Testing Plan

The testing strategy includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
Unit tests cover individual components and functions, ensuring they work as expected in isolation.
Integration tests verify the interaction between components and the proper functioning of the system as a whole.
End-to-end tests validate the entire flow of the orchestrating service, from receiving a request to routing it to the appropriate endpoint and returning the response.
Test cases should cover various scenarios, including:

Valid and invalid configuration files
Endpoint registration and unregistration
Health check scenarios (healthy, unhealthy, and circuit breaker states)
Authentication and authorization scenarios
Error handling and edge cases


Automated testing is set up using a testing framework such as pytest.
Continuous Integration (CI) is configured to run the test suite on each code change.

Deployment and Monitoring

The service is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
Deployment is automated using a Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline.
The service is deployed to a production environment, such as a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
Monitoring and alerting are set up using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track key metrics and ensure the service's health and performance.
Metrics to monitor include:

Request rate and latency
Error rate and types
Endpoint availability and uptime
Circuit breaker state and transitions


Alerts are configured for critical issues and anomalies, notifying the relevant team members.
